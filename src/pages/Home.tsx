            <h2> About </h2>
            <p> 
                I am a second year Computing Science Student at the University of Alberta. 
                I have contributed frontend web development to two startups (focused on <i>artificial intelligence</i> and <i>ergonomic keyboards</i>, respectively)
                and one neuroscience clinic. 
                I fell in love with programming through <strong>game development</strong>, and my current interests
                are creating <strong>websites</strong>, exploring <strong>operating systems</strong> and learning as much as I can about the field.
            </p>
